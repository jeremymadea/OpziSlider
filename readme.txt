=== OpziSlider === 

== Description == 
================================================================================
OpziSlider is a simple slider plugin based on flexslider. Slides are a custom 
post type and custom fields are permitted. Slides may be grouped so that a 
slider instance can be restricted to the slides in a requested group. A 
template tag (function) is provided to get an array of slides. This is the only
currently supported method of creating a slider. Multiple sliders are only 
partially supported. There is one set of options affecting all sliders. You can
create different sliders for different pages (templates) but multiple sliders
on a single page may be problematic. (Untested.)
